  about:{
    intro:"The {text=National Research Council Canada,hyperlink=https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/research-centres/ocean-coastal-river-engineering-research-centre} has developed the Marine Energy Resources Atlas Canada (Arctic) application to map tidal flows and hydrokinetic energy near communities in northern Canada. The application allows to investigate and assess the potentially exploitable tidal energy resources by providing spatial and temporal variation data such as tidal height, tidal currents, bed elevation and annual energy production.  The web application was developed using various packages such as {text=React,hyperlink=https://reactjs.org/}, {text=Mapbox,hyperlink=https://www.mapbox.com/} and {text=DeckGL,hyperlink=https://deck.gl/}, and is currently stored and delivered using {text=AWS,hyperlink=https://aws.amazon.com/} technologies.",
